# Overview

The most important thing to developers and product teams are tools that allow them to get to market faster and more secure. By enabling developers to streamline their processes and reduce time-to-market, they can gain a competitive edge in the industry. This not only accelerates their development cycles but also enhances their overall productivity, ultimately leading to greater success in their projects.

## Introducing FLOWS

The Flow APIs represent a new approach to Bitcoin DeFi development. In this new approach we attempt to tackle **DeFi** problems
instead of **Bitcoin development** problems.

In simple words, FLOWS allow a developer to use a ready-made succession of business steps related to Bitcoin using one simple API: the execute Flow API. Our platform takes care of and handles the underlying business logic and progression state.

Currently we are launching two very innovative products:

- [Staking Bitcoin Assets](staking/digital-assets.md)
- [Lending Bitcoin Assets](lending/digital-assets.md)
- [BTC Collateralization](#) (coming soon)
