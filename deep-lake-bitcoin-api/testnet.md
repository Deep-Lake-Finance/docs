# Testnet

The Deep Lake Testnet instances can be found here:&#x20;

GraphQL: https://api.test.deeplake.fi/graphql

Rest: https://api.tset.deeplake.fi/api/

Access to the Testnet API requires an API Key.  You can create this key from your developer dashboard here.

You will require Testnet Bitcoin for testing.  You can google search for existing faucets, or try this one: [https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet](https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/)

In order to acquire Testnet Ordinals, we recommend you use the Ordinal's bot inscription tool to create your own. \[[https://testnet.ordinalsbot.com/](https://testnet.ordinalsbot.com/)]\([https://testnet.ordinalsbot.com/](https://testnet.ordinalsbot.com/))
