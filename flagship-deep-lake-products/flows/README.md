# Flows

The most important thing that can be provided to developers and product teams is a tool that allows them to get faster to market. By enabling developers to streamline their processes and reduce time-to-market, they can gain a competitive edge in the industry. This not only accelerates their development cycles but also enhances their overall productivity, ultimately leading to greater success in their projects.

## This is why we introduced FLOWS

In simple words, flows allow a developer to use a ready-made succession of business steps related to Bitcoin using one simple API: the execute Flow API.  Our platform takes care of and handles the underlying logic.

We are launching two very innovative products:
