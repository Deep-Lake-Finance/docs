# "Easy Escrow" - Native BTC Liquidity & PoR

Deep Lake allows you to build your very own Bitcoin escrow into any application, use-case, or protocolâ€”decentralized or centralized. With the ability to use fully native, Layer-1 Bitcoin in smart contracts, you now can create trust-minimized, decentralized, and non-custodial applications. Truly Bitcoin-backed.

The platform leverages DLCs, which are a different type of smart contract used to accomplish native Bitcoin escrow and more.

### Who Is This For

* Entrepreneurs kickstarting their protocol in need of liquidity
* Pool operators looking to onboard native BTC liquidity
* Protocol builders looking to add Bitcoin as a collateral-type
